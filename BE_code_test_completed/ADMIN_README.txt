How To Administer This Test

Purpose:
The point of this test is to determine how well a person can adapt to knew languages and work within their particular syntax 
and limitaitons. It does not test for polymorphism, although that could be added in the future if necessary.

Creating the test:
1. run 'ruby prepare.rb' from this directory
2. cd ../../code_test
4. test that the javascript works in TW_JAVASCRIPT
	- open index.html in a browser
	- you should see the current weather for Los Angeles, CA
5. zip the new folder with removed pieces, all set to go!

Judging the test:
- how well were they able to resourcefully build these classes
- ruby is by far the easiest, php is a little more archane, java is compiled and there for more difficult for those who have not used a compiled language and bash should almost be considered torture (hence the use of ticktick.sh)
