72andSunny Backend Developer Code Test

Preparation:
You are being asked to port code from one language to another. Actually several others. The javascript version has been completed for you. The basic parts are as follows:

1. A function (method) that takes a twitter profile name.
2. A class that handles calling the Twitter API
3. A class that handles calling the Wunderground API (key is provided)
4. An output of the Weather for the location of the Twitter profile name passed to the original function (method). 
5. Output should look like this:

###########  (hashes not necessary) #########################
#															#
# 	Weather as of: Last Updated on October 8, 12:27 AM PDT  #
# 	Conditions: Clear 										#
# 	Temperature: 61.8 										#
#															#
#############################################################

This is not a complicated exercise, but it demonstrates the following abilities:
- Can use Google.
- Adapts to different languages
- Can assess and comprehend someone else's coding style
- Understands web technologies (browser, web server, permissions)
- Can read software documentation and install it
- Can debug the full web stackÂ ( at least for what we need )
- Has worked in a team environment and therefore is not afraid to ask for help.
- Can assess the time it will take to accomplish various tasks.
- Understands basic code syntax prinipals (namespacing, scoping, objects, etc.)

What not to worry about?
- don't need to create non-blocking code
- don't need to output to a HTML page. Command line echo is fine.
- don't need to null-proof it. Just get the major code in place
- don't worry about the json gem, just use ruby 1.9.2+ which includes a native library
- don't try to parse the json in BASH. You will kill yourself, and that doesn't help us. Just use ticktick, provided.

Instructions:
1. Contact us when you have read this file and are ready to begin the test.
2. Give us a time frame (be fair to yourself) to expect the completed test.
3. Finish the test, zip it up and email it to us with the answer to #4.
4. What is the average speed of a swallow?

Pretty simple, huh?
